# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview
I struggled with this challenge.  I could not get the overall winner to print.  I tried the Learning Assistant, but I don't think she understood my questions and was distracted by noisy kids in the background.  I am turning in this project knowing that it is not complete and accurate, but I know that I tried my best and spent many hours on it.  Office Hours this past week did not work with my schedule, so I know I can do more to get help and I need to manage my schedule better between work and taking care of my family.

I think I understand things more than I did last week, but not getting the final step to work was really frustrating and made me second guess if I really do understand or not.

## Challenge Summary
This script can be used for any election, whether city, county, or state.  Additional information would need to be gathered and defined in the code.  If using for a Presidential election, you could break out the votes by state to see which candidate had the most votes in each state and then the overall winner by popular vote.  You could also use the code to determine which state had the most votes.
